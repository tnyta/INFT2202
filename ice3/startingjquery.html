            <p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
            <p>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Saving the world with meals on wheels. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>

            <p>No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
